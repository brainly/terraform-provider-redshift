# redshift_datashare (Resource)

Defines a Redshift datashare. Datashares allows a Redshift cluster (the "consumer") to
read data stored in another Redshift cluster (the "producer"). For more information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/datashare-overview.html

The redshift_datashare resource should be defined on the producer cluster.

Note: Data sharing is only supported on certain Redshift instance families,
such as RA3.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example: data share which includes all tables/views and functions in the specified schema.
# New tables/views and functions are automatically added to the datashare.
resource "redshift_datashare" "datashare_auto" {
  name = "my_automatic_datashare" # Required
  owner = "my_user" # Optional

  schema {
    name = "public" # Required
    mode = "auto" # Required
  }
}

# Example: data share which explicitly specifies tables/views and functions
resource "redshift_datashare" "datashare_manual" {
  name = "my_manual_datashare" # Required

  schema {
    name = "public" # Required
    mode = "manual" # Required
    tables = [ # Optional. If unspecified then no tables/views will be added.
      "my_table",
      "my_view",
      "my_late_binding_view",
      "my_materialized_view",
    ]
    functions = [ # Optional. If unspecified then no functions will be added.
      "my_sql_udf",
    ]
  }
}

# Example: Datashare that can be shared with publicly available consumer clusters.
resource "redshift_datashare" "publicly_accessible_datashare" {
  name = "my_public_datashare" # Required
  publicly_accessible = true # Optional. Default is `false`

  schema {
    name = "public" # Required
    mode = "auto" # Required
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **name** (String) The name of the datashare.

### Optional

- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **owner** (String) The user who owns the datashare.
- **publicly_accessible** (Boolean) Specifies whether the datashare can be shared to clusters that are publicly accessible. Default is `false`.
- **schema** (Block Set) Defines which objects in the specified schema are exposed to the data share (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--schema))

### Read-Only

- **created** (String) The date when datashare was created
- **producer_account** (String) The ID for the datashare producer account.
- **producer_namespace** (String) The unique cluster identifier for the datashare producer cluster.

### Nested Schema for `schema`

Required:

- **mode** (String) Configures how schema objects will be exposed to the datashare. Must be either `auto` or `manual`.

  In `auto` mode, all tables, views, and UDFs will be exposed to the datashare, and Redshift will automatically expose new tables, views, and functions in the schema to the datashare (without requiring `terraform apply` to be run again).

  In `manual` mode, only the `tables` and `functions` explicitly declared in the `schema` block will be exposed to the datashare.
- **name** (String) The name of the schema

Optional:

- **functions** (Set of String) UDFs that are to exposed to the datashare. You should configure this attribute explicitly when using `manual` mode. When using `auto` mode, this is treated as a computed attribute and you should not explicitly declare it.
- **tables** (Set of String) Tables and views that are exposed to the datashare. You should configure this attribute explicitly when using `manual` mode. When using `auto` mode, this is treated as a computed attribute and you should not explicitly declare it.
