# redshift_datashare_privilege (Resource)

Manages consumer permissions for [data sharing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/datashare-overview.html).

When managing datashare permissions between clusters in the same account, set the `namespace` to the consumer's namespace guid, and omit the `account`.

When managing data share permissions across AWS accounts, set the `account` to the consumer's AWS account ID, and omit the `namespace`.
After creating the privilege through terraform, you will also need to [authorize the cross-account datashare through the AWS console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/across-account.html) before consumer clusters can access it.

Note: Data sharing is only supported on certain instance families, such as RA3.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "redshift_datashare" "share" {
  name = "my_datashare"
}

# Example: datashare permission in same account
resource "redshift_datashare_privilege" "within_account" {
  name = redshift_datashare.share.name # Required
  namespace = "d34dbe3f-d34d-b33f-d3ad-b33fd34db33f" # Required
}

# Example: cross-account datashare permission.
# Note: you will also need to authorize the cross-account datashare
# in the AWS console after creating this resource
resource "redshift_datashare_privilege" "cross_account" {
  name = redshift_datashare.share.name # Required
  account = "123456789012" # Required
}
```
